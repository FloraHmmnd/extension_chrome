# extension_chrome

This Chrome extension is built to convert any site into a "zen" mode.
Images are changed into color gradients making think to some minimalist paintings.
Also fonts are changed to Tahoma, a font which responds to accessible reading norms.
Then some hard words are changed to soft words. For an example "crisis" could become "party".
We try to improve this extension to allow each user to change parameters and personnalize it.
